Hola!

Here you can find a program that creates an audiobook of Roger Penrose's Road to Reality!

A few notes: 

1. Make sure the text file is in Unicode-8

2. Google Text to Speech doesn't seem to like large chunks of characters, so this program creates audio files 100,000 characters at a time. 
There are 2,740,699 characters in this book, so that's 28 separate tracks.

3. This converter creates WAV files. I'm using these purely for the sake of my audio editor. Once they're done I'll convert them to M4a, 
which allows a user to exit the program and come back to the same spot. 


An Issue I'd like to fix:

The synthetic voice can't read out math equations very well. I'd like to fix this, perhaps by physically writing in the words
she is supposed to say.
